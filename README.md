# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
Tic Tac Toe is a classic game played on a 3x3 grid by two players, typically labeled as "X" and "O". Players take turns marking empty cells in an attempt to form a row of three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The first player to achieve this wins the game.
